TODO

app workflow:
1. set your weekly tasks: each week, look at unifinished tasks under each milestone (date doesn't matter), and assign some of the tasks for this week (due date friday of this week).
2. each day, take from the weekly tasks, and change the due date to the daily tasks

- fix highlight_dates() and task tree errors when running `due week`
    - take course on datetime in python from datacamp
    - re-implement this code relying on datatime std library as much as possible

- need to specify how to make root, child and empty tasks with a 'kind' attribute. Also need to change all the functions that make reference to name=root


some important views:
- list all long-term tasks (list only milestone tasks `due ls root --depth 1` should have a shortcut of some kind)
- list all long-term tasks with subtasks (should have a shortcut to `due ls` that shows without root)
- list a long-term tasks (milestone) with subtasks (ordered by due date) (this means sorting the tree by date)
- list this week's tasks group by milestone (each milestone ordered, in turn, by deadline) (same sort function, different depth)
- [DONE] list today's tasks
- export data as time series json for vega
- [DONE] show calendar in terminal (maybe with cal) https://askubuntu.com/questions/889112/is-there-a-command-to-display-a-calendar-in-the-terminal

- modify the .to_json() method to work with more node types than just root, so that other nodes can be output as json and piped to other applications
- modify the .from_json() method to work with more node types than just the root, so that if you wanted to create a new task from a json file on the command line (like a milestone task), you could just write out a file, instead of punching it in the command line one by one.
- in the same way you implement  .to_json()  and .from_json() implement...
    - .from_yaml()
    - .to_yaml()
- due config --taskfile 'path/to/taskfile.json' should set a new default in the yaml config file 
- need due init command to create a new json file if none exists. Where should application files be stored on linux? on windows? on mac? should I just put it in the user directory. 

- due backup --yaml 'filename.yaml'
- due backup --json 'filename.json'

- due reschedule --id 1.0 'new deadline' / due res -i 1.0 'new deadline' (remember to store when this deadline was originally scheduled in deadline_changes attribute)

the following functions should modify the source json file in addition to the task objects
- due add --id 1.0 'task name' 'deadline' --repeat 'weekly:smtwtfs' --until 'date'
    - --repeat daily
    - --repeat weekly:smtwtfs
    - --repeat monthly
    - --repeat yearly
    * extra feature: accept cron job syntax here
    * extra feature: 'custom' monthly feature like "once every 2nd tuesday of the month"


- due week +1 (due next week)
- due week -1 (due last week)
- due week 3 (due 3rd week of year)

find out how to set up virtual environment
- due ls --json (pipe out json to other applications)
- due ls --yaml (pipe out yaml to other applications)
- due ls --md (pipe out mardkown to other applications)

- write requirements.txt after seeing what libraries you're missing from your vanilla virtual environment

- write docstrings for every method in the task class
- argparse help menu setup

- write a setup.py and a manifest.in file and then publish package to the test pypl instance mentioned here: https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/#a-small-python-package
- try to install the application and test for bugs on your mac/linux make a checklist of things you could check for in the display options

assert that deadlines of subtasks always be before or on the day of parent
tasks in the .add_subtask() method in the Task class.

look into the following links for testing and badges. I really want this project to be professional and maintainable.

* extra feature: use tree structure for tasks like this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59109706/7215135

* extra feature: add week number loading bar to the today, week, tomorrow display functions.
* extra feature: add loading bar for specific milestones to show how close until deadline
* extra feature: I like the upcoming tasks view from todoster as seen here: https://github.com/SophieAu/todoster/blob/master/header.png

* extra feature: you could add a utility to gather # TODO's from code with
    lines of text, filenames, and project names which could be added to your milestone tasks
    you could assign deadlines to them later on

TODO: display an "error log" for each deferment as follows:
    list summary statistics for each category of deferment
    milestone_name
        deferments of TaskList
            deferment_date    task_name   from    to  category    justification
        deferments of subtasks
            deferment_date    task_name   from    to  category    justification

TODO: implement function to filter deferments by category

TODO: put type hints in all functions

    read the following articles and make flashcards: https://pymotw.com/3/datetime/index.html  https://pymotw.com/3/time/index.html
    read through the argparse tutorial from the python docs it's very good: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html

Examples for documentation
    # print(t.filter(lambda x: x.deadline == datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')))
    print('↓search↓')
    print(t.search(lambda x: x.complete == True))
    
    print('↓promote↓')
    for s1 in t.subtasks:
        for s2 in s1.promote(lambda x: x.deadline <= '2021-03-18'):
            print(s2)
    

DONE
---
- due today / due td
- due tomorrow / due tm
- due week (due this week) show  the week number, this week's date range, and all tasks due for the week
- due add --id 1.0 'task name' 'deadline'
- due done --id 1.0 / due  --id 1.0
- due rm --id 1.0
- due (by itself, this should show everything due today, over your weekly todo list)
- due ls / due (list all tasks that are uncompleted)
it should be an option to print todo's
    without the deadline date (this should be the default for 'due today')
    with or without the task id's
    also task id's should be chained to make it easier to remove them by id.
-  figure out how to set the default file to search for to make the root task/task tree.
- is there a better way to work with the todo file filepaths and configurations files? Which file module should I use? Yes, pathlib is the default since python 3.4. https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/
- re-organize project according to the directory structure described in https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/#a-small-python-package
- separate due.py into three files: __init__.py, __main__.py, task.py
- read about different types of config files and select one to use (chose YAML): https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/
